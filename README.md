# LaunchDorkly

An attempted different approach to a LaunchDarkly UI

[Deployed Demo](https://launchdorkly.vercel.app/)

## Description

The purpose of this project is to give easier control and visibility of some basic LaunchDarkly project configurations.

### List of what this project can do

This is a WIP but:

- Give you the target status of all project feature flags on one screen
  - With the ability to toggle them in a single click
- Compare settings from one LD project to another
  - With the ability to update the second project with original project's targets/variations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before using this project

This project takes zero responsibility of unintended or destructive changes to your LaunchDarkly setup.
This project isn't intended to manage everything LaunchDarkly but just a UI on top of the API calls.
